##Add a modal confirmation before deleting a clicker item

We want to show a modal (something styled like an alert but with more content) before removing a clicker.

#Requirements
1. Show a modal dialog when the user clicks on a delete clicker button
2. Style the modal to look like an alert. ie semi-transparent backdrop and centered box with content and buttons
3. Only show the alert if the clicker has more than one clicks, otherwise delete clicker without prompt
